# swimming-qualifications
This project helps users who swim to add and see their times as well as to see if they qualify for nationals, regionals etc.
## Sample Data
Sample data is included in the repo under json files.  
  
## Code Functionality
The code will read the json files, asking for the user's age.  
Afterwards, the users will be asked whether they want to edit (add records) to their records or see what they qualify for (see records).    
If the user wants to, they will choose the stroke(50free, 50fly, etc) and append to the personal record by replacing original value if better. If the user wants to see what he qualifies for, they will be asked for the stroke and according to the personal records the user is qualified based on rqt or nqt.
